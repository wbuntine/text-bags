text-bags version 0.7
====================
This is a module for preprocessing text collections
to create dictionaries and bag/list files for use
by topic modelling software.  Output is in various
sparse vector formats (ldac, Matlab Topic Toolbox, libsvm, ...).
Scripts are also given for extracting
data from WEX files (Wikipedia dumps), PubMed XML and
Reuters RCV1 files.  The input format is a simple text file
with fielded entries for things like text, links and categories,
in UTF-8. The format described in the linkTables man page.

Examples are given in the examples/ directory.

Installed system provides these scripts:
	linkBags   linkCoCo   linkMatch linkParse linkTokens
        linkRedir  linkSent   linkTables    wex2link linkText
These do things like:
     * sentence splitting (split paragraphs into sentences)
     * running text on Sydney U's C&C parser (experimental)
     * stemming, tokenisation
     * dictionary filtering
     * building a co-occurrence matrix for all the Wikipedia

The system is implemented as a suite of Perl programmes.  If you
do not already have Perl on your system, then you would have to have it
installed via a pre-built package.   Perl does not mix as well with
Windows, but excellent support exists for other systems.

DEPENDENCIES
============
To install the text-bags suite first install the Perl prerequisities.
To install prerequisities using Perl, first you run "cpan".  
Basic instructions are given below, but if you encounter trouble see:
     http://perl.about.com/od/packagesmodules/qt/perlcpan.htm
for a guide on this.  You should have systems privileges to do this
properly.  On Linux or MacOSX you do the same thing.
If you have't run cpan before, then start it up once
in command line mode to set the defaults:
    sudo cpan
Then run to do the installs of prereq packages.
    sudo cpan install Digest::MD5 Encode FileHandle File::Tail 
    sudo cpan install Getopt::Long HTML::Entities POSIX
    sudo cpan install IO::Handle IO::Pipe Lingua::EN::Sentence
    sudo cpan install Lingua::Stem Pod::Usage URI XML::Parser
These are standard packages so all should go smoothly.

INSTALLATION
===========
It is best to do the install in your own directory, 
but then you need to set up your man path, library path, etc.,
so these can be accessed.  You need something like:
   PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
   PERLLIB=$HOME/share/perl/5.14.2
   export PERLLIB
added to your ".profile" under Linux/MacOSX.
Add these carefully so as not to conflict with existing entries.
Note the version number "5.14.2" is system independent.
To see what version you have, type:
   perl -V | tail
and look at the library includes.

On Linux or MacOSX you do the same thing to make and install.
Type one of the following to initialise: 
	# for an install in your own directory
   	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME
OR 
	# to install globally on the system
	#    (which is harder to uninstall)
   	perl Makefile.PL

Then do the following two commands:
   	make
   	make test

Now if the tests fail then you cannot proceed.
Please email a copy of the error message to Wray Buntine.

Then finally
	#  to install locally, if you used 'PREFIX=$HOME'
        make install
OR
	#  to install globally on the system
	sudo make install

To use C&C parsing option, which is experimental, install the parser
from their website
	http://svn.ask.it.usyd.edu.au/trac/candc/
and define the environment variable CANDCHOME to be the root
of the installation.  


Getting Started
===============
Install the software.
Then work through the example in examples/starthere/
and the man pages do a basic job of describing options.
Note the webpage
       http://www.nicta.com.au/people/buntinew/softwareanddata
should have links to some interesting datasets to try.

linkParse does a parse but doesn't integrate anything
back.   Note always run linkSent on the files first so C&C gets
sentence-sized chunks to parse, not massive text blocks.
